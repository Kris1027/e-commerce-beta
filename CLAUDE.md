# E-Commerce Template - Development Guide

## Project Overview
Production e-commerce template with Next.js 15.5.2, TypeScript (strict), Prisma/PostgreSQL (Neon), NextAuth v5. Poland-only shipping.

## Critical Rules

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, explicit types, no `any`
- **Components**: Server by default, client only when needed, <200 lines
- **UI**: ALWAYS use shadcn/ui components, Lucide icons
- **Security**: Zod validation on client+server, httpOnly cookies
- **Errors**: Always `catch (error)`, log with console.error
- **Performance**: No `router.refresh()`, use state updates

### Key Patterns
```typescript
// Prices: formatCurrency() for all prices
formatCurrency(100) // "100,00 zÅ‚"

// Server Actions: Always use for data ops
import { getProducts } from '@/lib/actions/product-actions'

// Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
const form = useForm<T>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) })

// Toast: Semantic variants
toast.success('Product added')
toast.error('Failed to save')
```

## Tech Stack
- **Core**: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5.9.2
- **DB**: Prisma 6.15.0, PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Auth**: NextAuth v5 (5.0.0-beta.29)
- **UI**: Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons, Sonner toasts
- **State**: Zustand 5.0.8
- **Forms**: React Hook Form 7.62.0, Zod 4.1.5
- **File Upload**: UploadThing 7.7.4

## Project Structure
```
/app                # App Router pages
/components/ui      # shadcn components + custom (SearchInput, PaginationWrapper)
/lib/actions        # Server actions (REQUIRED for data ops)

```

## Key Components & Utilities

### Custom UI Components
- **SearchInput** - Real-time search with debouncing, no flickering
- **PaginationWrapper** - Unified pagination with shadcn/ui
  - Props: `preserveParams`, `showFirstLast`, `showPageInfo`
- **ProductImageUpload** - Drag-and-drop image upload with preview, reordering, and progress tracking
  - Props: `value`, `onChange`, `maxImages`, `disabled`
  - Features: Multi-file upload, drag to reorder, image preview, delete individual images

### Business Constants (`/lib/constants/cart.ts`)
- `FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 100` PLN
- `SHIPPING_PRICE = 10` PLN
- `TAX_RATE = 0.23` (Polish VAT)
- `MAX_QUANTITY_PER_ITEM = 99`
- `HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD = 1000` PLN

### Essential Server Actions
```typescript
// User/Admin
getCurrentUser()
getUsersForAdmin(page, search?, filters?)
updateUserAsAdmin(userId, data)
getCustomerStatistics()

// Orders/Cart
getMyOrders(page)
getCart()
addToCart(item)

// Admin Orders Management
getOrdersForAdmin(page, search?, statusFilter?, paymentFilter?, sortBy?)
getOrderSummary()
updateAdminOrderStatus(orderId, status)
getAdminOrderById(orderId)
deleteOrder(orderId)

// Admin Products Management (admin-product-actions.ts)
getProductsForAdmin(page, search?, categoryFilter?, stockFilter?, featuredFilter?, sortBy?)
getProductStatistics()
getProductById(id) // Admin-only, fetches product for editing
getAllCategoryNames() // Returns all unique category names
deleteProduct(id) // Admin-only with auth check, auto-deletes images from storage
createProduct(data) // Admin-only with auth check
updateProduct(data) // Admin-only with auth check, auto-cleans removed images

// Wishlist
getWishlist()
toggleWishlist(productId)

// Categories
getCategories()
getProductsByCategory(category, page)

// UploadThing File Management (uploadthing-actions.ts)
deleteUploadThingFiles(fileKeys) // Admin-only, deletes files from storage
deleteUploadThingFilesByUrls(urls) // Admin-only, extracts keys and deletes
```

### Custom Hooks
- **useNavigationGuard** - Prevents navigation with unsaved changes
  - Options: `shouldBlock`, `onBlock`, `message`
  - Intercepts both browser navigation (back button, refresh) and Next.js router navigation
  - Usage: Product form protection, preventing loss of uploaded images

### Polish Localization
- Currency: PLN (formatCurrency handles zÅ‚/gr)
- Phone: +48 XXX-XXX-XXX format
- Address: Voivodeship field, XX-XXX postal codes
- Date/Time: pl-PL locale, 24-hour format
