# E-Commerce Template - Implementation Tracker

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Update this file after implementing each new feature or making significant changes to the project.

## Project Vision
This is a **production-ready e-commerce template** designed to be the foundation for multiple e-commerce stores. The architecture prioritizes:
- **100% Reusability**: Core functionality that works for any e-commerce business
- **Easy Customization**: Simple configuration changes for branding, styling, and features
- **Scalability**: Built to handle growth from startup to enterprise
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code that's easy to update and extend

## Template Architecture Principles
1. **Configuration-Driven**: All store-specific settings in environment variables and config files
2. **Theme System**: Complete visual customization through CSS variables and Tailwind config
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable features per deployment
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add/remove features without breaking core functionality
5. **API-First**: Decoupled backend for flexibility in data sources
6. **Multi-tenant Ready**: Single codebase serving multiple stores
7. **Industry-Agnostic**: Components and features must work for ANY type of e-commerce store (electronics, clothing, food, services, digital products, etc.). Avoid industry-specific terminology or UI elements

## Development Standards & Best Practices

### ⚠️ **MANDATORY CODE QUALITY RULES**

#### 1. **TypeScript Standards**
- ✅ ALWAYS use strict TypeScript mode
- ✅ Define explicit types for all props, state, and functions
- ✅ Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- ✅ Use interfaces for objects, types for unions/primitives
- ✅ Export types separately from components

#### 2. **React/Next.js Best Practices**
- ✅ Use `'use client'` directive only when necessary (client interactivity)
- ✅ Implement proper loading and error boundaries
- ✅ Use Next.js Image component for all images
- ✅ Implement proper SEO with metadata
- ✅ Use server components by default for better performance
- ✅ Implement proper suspense boundaries for async operations

#### 3. **Component Architecture**
- ✅ Single Responsibility: One component, one purpose
- ✅ Keep components under 200 lines
- ✅ Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- ✅ Use composition over inheritance
- ✅ Implement proper prop validation

#### 4. **Folder Structure**
```
/app              - Next.js app router pages
/components       
  /ui            - Reusable UI primitives (buttons, inputs)
  /layout        - Layout components (header, footer)
  /features      - Feature-specific components
  /home          - Page-specific components
/lib             
  /utils         - Utility functions
  /hooks         - Custom React hooks
  /validators    - Zod schemas and validation
  /actions       - Server actions for data operations
/config          - App configuration
/types           - TypeScript type definitions
/public          - Static assets
/db              - Database/sample data
```

#### 5. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Implement error boundaries for all pages
- ✅ Use try-catch for async operations
- ✅ Provide user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Log errors to monitoring service in production
- ✅ Never expose sensitive error details to users
- ✅ Implement proper 404 and error pages

#### 6. **Performance Optimization**
- ✅ Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- ✅ Implement proper image optimization
- ✅ Use React.memo for expensive components
- ✅ Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- ✅ Minimize bundle size - check with `next build`
- ✅ Use proper caching strategies

#### 7. **Accessibility (a11y)**
- ✅ Semantic HTML elements
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus management
- ✅ Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Alt text for all images

#### 8. **Code Style**
- ✅ Use Prettier for formatting
- ✅ ESLint for code quality
- ✅ No console.log in production code
- ✅ Comments only for complex logic
- ✅ Self-documenting code with clear naming
- ✅ TODO comments must include ticket/issue reference

#### 9. **State Management**
- ✅ Use React state for component-level state
- ✅ Use Zustand for global state (already installed)
- ✅ Keep state as close to usage as possible
- ✅ Avoid prop drilling - use context or state management

#### 10. **Security**
- ✅ Sanitize all user inputs
- ✅ Never expose API keys or secrets
- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Implement proper CORS policies
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Validate all data on both client and server

#### 11. **Testing Requirements** (When Implemented)
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for API routes
- Component testing for critical UI
- E2E tests for critical user flows

#### 12. **Git Commit Standards**
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### **Before Every Commit Checklist**
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` - must pass with no errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` - must build successfully
- [ ] Check for console.log statements
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Ensure no commented-out code
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if adding new patterns
